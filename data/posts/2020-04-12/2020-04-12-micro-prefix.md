The rise of 'micro-'.

<!-- end -->

## 'micro-' what?

The Prefix 'micro-' is coming into it's own in the field of software engineering. Microservices, micro-kubenetes (Minikube), micro-tools, micro-VMs etc. Formally none of these exist but we are trending towards smaller bundles, bite-sized applications and deployments, and even trying to minify our runtime with tools like Docker. Small/micro- may not be the right term for this. But as the amount of tools and environments we need to use and support has grown, the more urgent a need has shown up to isolate and segment our thought process as software engineers into more managable and composable pieces.

## Exploring 'micro-' to generate startup ideas

After seeing this chart about startups mapped to Craigslist sections I had the idea of exploring what kind of startups could be made just by attaching 'micro-' to already existing products, tools, ideas and companies. Some of my inspiration for applying it to startup ideas comes from this [2020 Startup Themes List](https://dcgross.com/2020-startup-themes/?src=t).

* **micro-Deployments**: sounds promising. Using minified containers/images to run your build or deployments.
* **micro-Advertising**
* **micro-Code**: Tools or GUI based programming to reduce the amount of code that you have to write/generate?
* **micro-Search**: 'Human' or rank curated search engine results minifier. Removes sites that are deemed spammy, have inaccurate information, biased etc.
* **micro-Images**
* **micro-Cloud**
* **micro-Drive**: Auto-zips your files when uploading to Cloud Storage Drive to maximize space.

I see some interesting ideas sprouting but nothing too solid. Play along by looking at [this job list](https://unawaz.github.io/stochastic-hill-climbing/tasks/) and seeing if 'micro-' fits the mold.
