There is a power in comparison.

## 'Using Metaphors for Learning

I stumbled upon a little fun game that I use now and then for learning different software engineering concepts. Whenever I want to check my understanding of a concept or tool like OOP, or Security or React I will grab a random noun or concept from my head and try to compare them together and draw out a meaning from it. Some examples:

* Docker is like a Kitchen in that ...
* NLP is like a Nuclear Reactor in that ...
* React is like a Car in that ...
* OOP is like a Forest in that ...

## Two Technologies

Also, in the same vein, testing your systems design skills can be easily done by choosing two different concepts, tools, or technologies and thinking up a use case where they can be used together or a new technology that exists at the intersection of the two.

* Docker + React
* GCP + Mobile Phones
* VR + Spotify 

I think there is potential for a site that throws random words out like a game and gets you thinking about comparing different nouns + software engineering concepts and tools. We need more simple and focused sites in this world anyways.
