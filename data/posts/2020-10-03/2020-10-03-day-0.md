EMBARKING. ALL ABOARD.

<!-- end -->

## Day 0

I guess I am trying to commit myself to more project making in these weird times. I have a lot I need to learn still, and a long career ahead of me. More courses, more books, more projects. What's the point in learning something if you aren't able to showcase it DIRECTLY? Which is why I am going to do at least 1 _project_ a day. It could be a script, a full website, a snippet, does it matter? This is about having fun through project-based learning, and building a kickass blog and portfolio.

## We NEED more dumb projects. We need more FUN projects.

Title says it all.

## Primes

Anyways, here's a script that I was messing with prime generation. The basic premise is that a prime number is some additive sum of 2-3 other prime numbers, but two of those prime numbers are exactly the ones less than but closest to _half_ the original. It obviously did not work. But actually I got led to another interesting idea: each prime number _contains_ another prime number that can be made from the digits of the original prime (or multiple) and when you subtract this contained prime from the original, you get a number that is guaranteed to be divisible by 10.
